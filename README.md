# zeiss_coding_challenge  

Handling gaps in time series dataset from temperature readings for the development of anomaly
detection algorithm.  

The notebook 'Arash_Azhand_Zeiss_Challenge_Temperature_Sensor.ipynb' is a first start in exploring the data set and thereby extracting valuable insights and assumptions which later will lead to modelling.  
Some ideas for artificial data sampling and anomaly detection modelling is provided at the end of the notebook.
